          While drag-and-drop platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace
          promise convenience, they often come at the cost of{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">performance</strong>,{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">security</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">scalability</strong>.
          These platforms rely heavily on plugins and bloated code, making your
          site slower, harder to customize, and more vulnerable to bugs or
          attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, a{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">hand-coded website</strong>{" "}
          gives you full control — from pixel-perfect UI design to backend
          logic. No unnecessary plugins. No generic layouts. Just clean,
          maintainable code built specifically for{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">your brand and your
          audience</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Custom-coded sites are{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">lighter and faster</strong>,
          making them ideal for businesses that care about{" "}
          <em>loading speed, SEO rankings, and conversions</em>. And as your
          business grows, your website scales with it — no platform limits or
          feature lock-ins.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you're building an eCommerce platform, a portfolio, or a SaaS
          dashboard — a coded site gives you{" "}
          <strong className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">
            freedom, performance, and a professional edge
          </strong>{" "}
          that cookie-cutter builders simply can't match.
